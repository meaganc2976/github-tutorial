## Git vs. GitHub
* Difference between Git and Github:
  * Git is version control. Git is a tool that keeps track of changes.
  * Github uses git or needs it to work, and is a website or cloud that stores all of the code. It is also used for collaboration with others.
        
* How you use it: 
 * In order to use Github, you would go to the website github.com and set up an account. There you can visually see your work or your changes. 
 * In order to use git, you would type `git init` in the command line to set up or start up git in a certain folder. Then you would type in different git commands in order to create different projects and make changes, such as `git add`,  `git clone`,  `git commit`, and more.
